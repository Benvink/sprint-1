  how would you describe the command line to a lay person?

I would say that a command line is similar to giving a person directions on the street, except describing in meticulous detail the directions, what to collect at each interval, and the way back. 

  List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do. (using the map example above)

1. pwd - shows you exactly where you are on the map right now
2. cd - shows you where you will be next
3. cd ~ - takes you back to where you started 
4. Ls -  gives you more details about your current location, the surrounding sites, and points of interest
5. mkdir - you can create a interesting buidling or landmark
6. rmdir - you can remove an interesting building, or landmark
7. touch - you can create objects inside of the building or landmark (or think of it as storing different items in a fridge, each item has different characteristics)
8. mv - you can change the name of the landmark, or point of interest to something you want, or move it else where
9. git - similar to a GPS device, whereby you plug in your directions and it tells you where to go, however its a collaboration of people all putting in data and telling where to go too.
10. Exit - is a simply a way of saying goodbye to those people you were showing directions too.
